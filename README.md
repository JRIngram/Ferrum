# Ferrum

Solution for Aston University's Game Development (CS3450) module.

# Introductory Information

## Prerequisites
Game Created in Unity 2018.3.4 and so if the project files are to be viewed then an editor of that version or later must be used.

If a Unity version of 2018.3.4 or later is not installed the Ferrum.exe file can still be ran and thus the game played.

If a Unity version of 2018.3.4 or later is not installed then the code files can still be viewed in a text editor; they will not be viewable in the Unity editor.
